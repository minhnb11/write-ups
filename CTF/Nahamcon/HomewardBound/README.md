# HomewardBound

According to the page we can only access the webpage through the local network. So i tried to add the `X-Forwarded-For` header to my `GET` request with the ip address `127.0.0.1`. Looks like it worked because the page gave me the flag:

```
flag{26080a2216e95746ec3e932002b9baa4}
```
